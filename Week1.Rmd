# Reasons and Preventive Measures
---

## .red[.bold[Reasons]]

* Several contributory factors such as .red[.bold[Poverty, lack of purchasing power, household food insecurity, and limited general knowledge]] about appropriate nutritional practices increase the risk of undernutrition in developing countries. 
* .red[.bold[The synergistic interaction between inadequate dietary intake and disease burden]] leads to a vicious cycle that accounts for much of the high morbidity and mortality in these countries.
* Three groups of underlying factors contribute to inadequate dietary intake and infectious disease: .red[.bold[inadequate maternal and child care, household food insecurity, and poor health services]] in an unhealthy environment.

---

## .green[.bold[Preventive Measures]]


Primary prevention measures taken to ensure more appropriate nutrient intakes in the population often include :
* .green[.bold[Education programs]] to encourage healthier and more nutritious food choices
* .green[.bold[Food-based approaches]] that increase the availability or affordability of nutrient-rich foods; and,
* .green[.bold[National policies]] to fortify commonly-eaten foods
