##  Nutritional Deficiency Deaths
]
In this section, I wanted to understand the trend of Nutritional Deficiency deaths worldwide from 1990. The World Health Organisation estimates that more than two billion people suffer from Nutritional Deficiency globally.   
  So with this data set, I am trying to answer **three** of the following research questions:
  
* How is the trend of  Nutritional Deficiency deaths worldwide from 1990?  

* Countries in the world with the highest deaths caused by Nutritional Deficiencies.  

* What are the preventive measures those countries can take to reduce these deaths?

         Country = "Entity")

#removing unwanted observations

# Reasons and Preventive Measures
---

## .red[.bold[Reasons]]

* Several contributory factors such as .red[.bold[Poverty, lack of purchasing power, household food insecurity, and limited general knowledge]] about appropriate nutritional practices increase the risk of undernutrition in developing countries. 
* .red[.bold[The synergistic interaction between inadequate dietary intake and disease burden]] leads to a vicious cycle that accounts for much of the high morbidity and mortality in these countries.
* Three groups of underlying factors contribute to inadequate dietary intake and infectious disease: .red[.bold[inadequate maternal and child care, household food insecurity, and poor health services]] in an unhealthy environment.

---

## .green[.bold[Preventive Measures]]


Primary prevention measures taken to ensure more appropriate nutrient intakes in the population often include :
* .green[.bold[Education programs]] to encourage healthier and more nutritious food choices
* .green[.bold[Food-based approaches]] that increase the availability or affordability of nutrient-rich foods; and,
* .green[.bold[national policies]] to fortify commonly-eaten foods
